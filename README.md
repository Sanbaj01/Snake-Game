I created this game on Day 20 and 21, of the 100 Day Python Challenge Bootcamp
# Snake-Game
This is the basic snake game, that we used to play once in our Nokia phones, when advance games where not available.

The program has been divided into separate modules of food, snake, scoreboard and the main file, using object oriented programming.
I have used the turtle library to create this game.
